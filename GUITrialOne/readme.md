Update:

use QFileDialog to select a file to open 

for testing, write result to a file uisng saveAs() and save()

make the GUI similiar to the master branch

Goal:

get the four functions work in a QT sytle instead of a pure c++ style

readFile()

getDataBlock()

subtractBlanks()

calculate_emFret()


From Dat:
