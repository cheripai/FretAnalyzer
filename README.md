Update:

use QFileDialog to select a file to open

for testing, write result to a file uisng saveAs() ans save()

make the GUI similiar to the master branch

Goal:

get the four functions work in a QT style instead of a pure c++ style **(Make sure they stay in a separate file and are imported into mainwindow.cpp)**

readFile()

getDataBlock()

subtractBlanks()

calculate_emFret()
