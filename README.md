Update:

GridStr readFile(string file);

testing getDatablock() now,

don't know why there is a out of range problem...

see pareser.h betweent the comment 'start' and 'finish'(already passed the test "Starting row was calculated incorrectly")

Goal:

get the four functions work in a QT style instead of a pure c++ style **(Make sure they stay in a separate file and are imported into mainwindow.cpp)**

readFile()

getDataBlock()

subtractBlanks()

calculate_emFret()
