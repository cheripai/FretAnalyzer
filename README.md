#TODO:
1. Python script should read input from QProcess communication rather than from file
2. X values should be user entered (error checking for doubles and correct size)
3. User should be able to save and reload their session 
4. Calculate button should grab file paths from textedits (in case of manual entry)
5. Write tests for all components
